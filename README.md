## üìñ API Documentation  

### Authentication  
- Use **JWT Token Authentication** for all protected routes.  
- Obtain a token by logging in or registering, and include it in the `Authorization` header for authenticated requests:  
  ```  
  Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE  
  ```  

### CRUD Endpoints  
#### Roles:  
- `GET /api/v1/roles` - List all roles.  
- `POST /api/v1/roles` - Create a new role.  
- `PUT /api/v1/roles/{id}` - Update a specific role.  
- `DELETE /api/v1/roles/{id}` - Delete a specific role.  

#### IpList:  
- `GET /api/v1/iplist` - List all IP addresses.  
- `POST /api/v1/iplist` - Add a new IP address.  
- `PUT /api/v1/iplist/{id}` - Update a specific IP address.  
- `DELETE /api/v1/iplist/{id}` - Delete a specific IP address.
